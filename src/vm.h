/*
 * An object is an unordered collection of properties.
 * A function stored in a property of an object is called a method.
 * A property has a name, a value, and set of attributes.
 * Attributes are: ReadOnly, DontEnum, DontDelete, Internal.
 *
 * A constructor is a function that creates and initializes objects.
 * Each constructor has an associated prototype object that is used for
 * inheritance and shared properties. When a constructor creates an object,
 * the new object references the constructorâ€™s prototype.
 *
 * Objects could be a "generic objects" which is a collection of properties,
 * or a "typed object" which also hold an internal value like String or Number.
 * Those values are implicit, unnamed properties of the respective types,
 * and can be coerced into primitive types by calling a respective constructor
 * as a function:
 *    var a = new Number(123);
 *    typeof(a) == 'object';
 *    typeof(Number(a)) == 'number';

 * Variables are function-scoped and are hoisted.

 * Scope is different from the execution context.
 * Execution context carries "variable object" which is variable/value
 * mapping for all variables defined in a function, and `this` object.
 * If function is not called as a method, then `this` is a global object.
 * Otherwise, `this` is an object that contains called method.
 * New execution context is created each time a function call is performed.
 * Passing arguments through recursion is done using execution context, e.g.
 *
 *    var factorial = function(num) {
 *      return num < 2 ? 1 : num * factorial(num - 1);
 *    };
 *
 * Here, recursion calls the same function `factorial` several times. Execution
 * contexts for each call form a stack. Each context has different variable
 * object, `vars`, with different values of `num`.
